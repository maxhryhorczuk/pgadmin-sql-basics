This repository contains my practice work with PostgreSQL using PGAdmin as I learn the fundamentals of SQL and database management. Iâ€™m following along with the Intro To PostgreSQL Databases With PgAdmin For Beginners video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dd2ej-QKrWY) to build a database, create tables, manipulate data with SQL commands, and explore database management. The SQL files in this repository showcase various SQL operations such as creating databases, defining tables, inserting data, and querying tables using SELECT, WHERE, LIKE, ORDER BY, and other commands. As I continue practicing and learning, I will add more SQL queries and explanations here.
